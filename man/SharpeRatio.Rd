\title{calculate a traditional or modified Sharpe Ratio of Return over StdDev or
VaR or ES}

\usage{
SharpeRatio(R, Rf = 0, alpha = 0.05, FUN="StdDev",annualize=FALSE)

}
\arguments{
\item{R}{an xts, vector, matrix, data frame, timeSeries or zoo object of
asset returns}

\item{Rf}{risk free rate, in same period as your returns}

\item{alpha}{Tail probability for VaR or ES, default alpha=.05}

\item{FUN}{one of "StdDev" or "VaR" or "ES" to use as the denominator}

\item{annualize}{if TRUE, annualize the measure, default FALSE}

}
\description{
The Sharpe ratio is simply the return per unit of risk (represented by
variability).  In the classic case, the unit of risk is the standard
deviation of the returns.

\details{
\deqn{\frac{\overline{(R_{a}-R_{f})}}{\sqrt{\sigma_{(R_{a}-R_{f})}}}}

William Sharpe now recommends \code{\link{InformationRatio}} preferentially
to the original Sharpe Ratio.

The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the combined performance of "risk"
and return.

As noted, the traditional Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure of return
that uses standard deviation to represent risk.

A number of papers now recommend using a "modified Sharpe" ratio using a
Modified Cornish-Fisher VaR or CVaR/Expected Shortfall as the measure of
Risk.
