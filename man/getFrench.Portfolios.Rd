This function connects with <"http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html"> and downloads the specified portfolio data constructed by factors. Currently, we support on retriving and arranging 24 portfolio datasets. Sometimes, the datafile contains multiple data tables, hence the code returns a list. Since the csv spreedsheet on the web is not structured data table, it does not only contain irregular headings, but also 7, or more, data tablesr; and the trivial portfolio data tables labelled by "Portfolio Formed by ..." are omitted. Check the "table.names" of output object.
